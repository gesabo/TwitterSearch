A basic Twitter Search using the REST API (https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public) that's 100% native and requires no dependencies (Fabric etc.) so that it can be used in a Playgroud.  Some of the oAuth code was taken from http://rshankar.com/retrieve-list-of-twitter-followers-using-swift/ many thanks.
